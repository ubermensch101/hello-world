                        I am but a student, in an institute little heard of, located in some far-off town somewhere, a place not many have had the chance to set their eyes upon, and I am afraid not many ever will.
                        I've got likes and dislikes, wants and wishes, but most of all, I've got regrets. As my skin fades and my teeth lose their shine, and, like my heroes before me, I crumble into an old chunk of coal,
                        I can't help but wonder if this was all it was meant to be. I've got <a href=projects.html>projects</a> and <a href=hobbies.html>hobbies</a>, I've got an <a href=education.html>education</a>... but what for?
                        A question that shall, perhaps, plague my mind to the end of my time on this ball of rock, this disc, what have you. Yet, don't let my tales dishearten you, dear readerâ€”feel free to look around,
                        for I have laid down my life for you, in ink.
